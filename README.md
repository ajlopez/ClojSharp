## Notes

- From [Special Forms](http://clojure.org/special_forms)
    * Any metadata on the symbol will be evaluated, and become metadata on the var itself.
    * Many macros expand into def (e.g. defn, defmacro), and thus also convey metadata for the resulting var from the symbol used as the name.
